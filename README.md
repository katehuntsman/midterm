## Overview
Organizations frequently need to classify data to support decision-making. 
For example, a healthcare provider may want to predict whether a patient has a specific condition based on lab results,
or a business may classify customer behavior to tailor marketing strategies.
Machine learning classification models help automate these decisions by recognizing patterns in historical data.

This project demonstrates your ability to apply classification modeling techniques to a real-world dataset. You will:
- Load and explore a dataset.
- Analyze feature distributions and consider feature selection.
- Train and evaluate a classification model.
- Compare different classification approaches.
- Document your work in a structured Jupyter Notebook.
- Conduct a peer review of a classmateâ€™s project.

## Dataset Options
Select one dataset from the list below. If you get good results, you can try the process on a suitable dataset of your own. 
A suitable dataset for classification includes:
- Categorical or numerical features that help predict the target.
- A **categorical target variable** for classification (binary or multiclass).
- Enough samples per class to effectively train and test a model.

1. **Mushroom Classification Dataset** (Predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on characteristics)
   - [UCI Mushroom Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mushroom)
2. **Titanic Survival Dataset** (Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster)
   - [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
3. **Banknote Authentication Dataset** (Predict whether a banknote is authentic based on wavelet-transformed images)
   - [UCI Banknote Authentication Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication)

## Assignment Requirements
Your Jupyter Notebook must follow a structured format with clearly numbered second-level headings and reflection remarks after each section.

Start your notebook professionally with:
- a single top-level title
- your name (or alias)
- the date
- a brief introduction that describes the problem and the dataset.
- Import the external Python libraries used (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn).

### Section 1. Import and Inspect the Data
- 1.1 Load the dataset and display the first 10 rows.
- 1.2 Check for missing values and display summary statistics.

Reflection 1: What do you notice about the dataset? Are there any data issues?

---

### Section 2. Data Exploration and Preparation
- 2.1 Explore data patterns and distributions
  - Create histograms, boxplots, and count plots for categorical variables (as applicable).
  - Identify patterns, outliers, and anomalies in feature distributions.
  - Check for class imbalance in the target variable (as applicable).
- 2.2 Handle missing values and clean data
  - Impute or drop missing values (as applicable).
  - Remove or transform outliers (as applicable).
  - Convert categorical data to numerical format using encoding (as applicable).
- 2.3 Feature selection and engineering
  - Create new features (as applicable).
  - Transform or combine existing features to improve model performance (as applicable).
  - Scale or normalize data (as applicable).

Reflection 2: What patterns or anomalies do you see? Do any features stand out? What preprocessing steps were necessary to clean and improve the data? Did you create or modify any features to improve performance?

---

### Section 3. Feature Selection and Justification
- 3.1 Choose features and target
  - Select two or more input features (numerical for regression, numerical and/or categorical for classification)
  - Select a target variable (as applicable)
    - Regression: Continuous target variable (e.g., price, temperature).
    - Classification: Categorical target variable (e.g., gender, species).
    - Clustering: No target variable.
  - Justify your selection with reasoning.
- 3.2 Define X and y
  - Assign input features to X
  - Assign target variable to y (as applicable)

Reflection 3: Why did you choose these features? How might they impact predictions or accuracy?

---

### Section 4. Train a Model (Classification: Choose 1: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- 4.1 Split the data into training and test sets using train_test_split (or StratifiedShuffleSplit if class imbalance is an issue).
- 4.2 Train model using Scikit-Learn model.fit() method.
- 4.3 Evalulate performance, for example:
  - Regression: R^2, MAE, RMSE (RMSE has been recently updated)
  - Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
  - Clustering: Inertia, Silhouette Score

Reflection 4: How well did the model perform? Any surprises in the results?

---

### Section 5. Improve the Model or Try Alternates (Implement a Second Option)
- 5.1 Train an alternative classifier (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) OR adjust hyperparameters on the original model.
- 5.2 Compare performance of all models across the same performance metrics.

Reflection 5: Which model performed better? Why might one classifier be more effective in this specific case?


---

### Section 6. Final Thoughts & Insights
- 6.1 Summarize findings.
- 6.2 Discuss challenges faced.
- 6.3 If you had more time, what would you try next?

Reflection 6: What did you learn from this project?
